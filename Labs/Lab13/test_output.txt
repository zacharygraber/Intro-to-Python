============================== Directional Graph ==============================
Testing if children are correct (Order does not matter)
	Node: 1, Result: [2, 6], Wanted: [2, 6]
	Node: 2, Result: [3], Wanted: [3]
	Node: 3, Result: [4], Wanted: [4]
	Node: 4, Result: [6], Wanted: [6]
	Node: 5, Result: [], Wanted: []

NOTE: It is okay if the result is off by 1 for each node
	Node: 1, Result: [1, 5], Wanted: [2, 6]
	Node: 2, Result: [0, 2], Wanted: [1, 3]
	Node: 3, Result: [1, 3], Wanted: [2, 4]
