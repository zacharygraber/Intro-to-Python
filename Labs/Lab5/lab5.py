# Will be stored in `Labs/Lab5/lab5.py`. 

# Tasks for this problem is:
# - In the python file, write (so overwrite the file each time) a series of non-repeating 
#   numbers (more than 10 numbers) to a file in the path `Labs/Lab5/storage.txt`
# - After writing to the file, read from the same file to get a total score
# - Append the total score to the file
